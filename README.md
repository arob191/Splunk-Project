This repository goes over the steps that I took to setup and install my Splunk Server.

Here's a summary of how I followed the Splunk core curriculum to set up my own Splunk server on my network, ingest logs from Event Viewer, and analyze traffic and sign-on activity:

Setup Splunk Server:

Successfully completed the Splunk core curriculum, which provided step-by-step instructions on setting up a Splunk server on my network.

-Learning: Gained proficiency in installing and configuring Splunk on a server within my network environment. Learned how to set up indexes, inputs, and data inputs to collect and index logs from various sources.
